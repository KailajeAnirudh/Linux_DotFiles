University of Notre Dame - Dr Wensing

Currently there's a need to handle unexpected terrain changes.

Another application: Assistive technology
How do you control a robot such that it does not impede the human's intentions. How do you get 
Prosthesis is easier as it's in series with human limb. 

Main method: MPC //who'd have thought??

Single rigid body dynamics. 

Hierarchical model is more robust compared to simple MPC, with upto 2-6 times lower computation that full body MPC.

Modle Identification

Survey of Prosthesis Control Landscape

Non-Volitional control

Volitional control: Takes inout from human directly. 
How do you make VC reliable with the vesatility of the NVC

How do you deal with noisy inputs?

Hybrid HVD

Study Protocol

- Screening: Enough residual muscular to get input
- Calibration
- Acclimation
- Walking
- Exploration

Calibration

Large variation in the input form the subject.
